Here is my implementation for the "Ala Carte" and "rectangular" multiplication. They two different algorithms used for multiplying large numbers, but each has its own strengths and weaknesses.
1. **Ala Carte Multiplication**:
   - **Algorithm**: The Ala Carte multiplication algorithm iterates over the bits of one of the multiplicands (`b` in this case) and accumulates partial products by left shifting one multiplicand (`a`) and right shifting the other (`b`).
   - **Pros**:
     - Simplicity: The algorithm is relatively simple and straightforward to implement.
     - No need for extra memory: It doesn't require additional data structures or memory beyond storing the result.
   - **Cons**:
     - Efficiency: It may not be as efficient for large numbers because it requires a loop over the bits of one of the multiplicands.
     - Limited applicability: It's best suited for small to moderate-sized numbers.

2. **Rectangular Multiplication**:
   - **Algorithm**: Rectangular multiplication breaks down the multiplication process into smaller, easier-to-handle steps. It represents each multiplicand as a string of digits and performs multiplication digit by digit.
   - **Pros**:
     - Versatility: It's more versatile and can handle larger numbers efficiently.
     - Memory efficiency: It uses extra memory for the grid, but this is generally manageable for moderate-sized numbers.
     - Readability: The algorithm's structure makes it easier to understand and reason about.
   - **Cons**:
     - Complexity: It's more complex to implement compared to Ala Carte multiplication, especially when dealing with carry handling and grid manipulation.
     - Extra memory usage: It requires additional memory to store the grid, which could be a concern for very large numbers.

**When you might want to choose Ala Carte multiplication**:
- When dealing with small to moderate-sized numbers where simplicity is prioritized over efficiency.
- When memory constraints are a concern, as Ala Carte multiplication doesn't require extra memory beyond storing the result.
- When the focus is on implementing a simple multiplication algorithm without additional complexity.
**When you might want to choose rectangular multiplication**:
- When dealing with larger numbers where efficiency is crucial, as rectangular multiplication is more versatile and can handle larger inputs efficiently.
- When readability and ease of understanding are important, as the algorithm's structure makes it easier to follow compared to bit manipulation.
- When flexibility is needed, as rectangular multiplication can be adapted to handle various data types and number representations.
